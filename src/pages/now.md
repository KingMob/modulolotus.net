# Matthew Davidson

## Where I'm at

Chiang Mai, Thailand. Songkran was a blast. It's started raining again. I got caught in my first thunderstorm last night.

## What I'm doing now

I will be taking over as co-owner of [Swarmify](https://swarmify.com), the startup I was CTO for many years ago.

Adding bind support to the OSH shell for Oils. Adding readline environment variable support.

## For fun

D&D: I'm a level 6 Blood Hunter in a Curse of Strahd campaign. 

Currently, we're in Vallaki. Our drow monk went off on his own to engage the hag Morgantha. He came back with eight dream pies made from children, and tried to dispose of them on the roof. Unfortunately, a bunch of preteen were-ravens ate them, started tripping, and it turns out their the inn-keepers' children. We're all hoping to quietly disappear in the morning without them knowing. ðŸ˜¬
