This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Where I'm at

Chiang Mai, Thailand. It's warming up as the "winter" ends, tourists are thinning out a bit. Starting to get a bit smoggy, but we haven't truly entered the burning season yet. (I love saying "burning season", it reminds me of N.K. Jemisins's [_Broken Earth_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Season_(novel)) books.)

## Software

CTO and co-owner of [Swarmify](https://swarmify.com). I'm modernizing the codebase, addressing bug reports, etc. Just working a lot.

Haven't worked on [Oils](https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils) in a bit, got too busy with work. 

## Reading

- _Vibe Coding_ by Yegge and Kim. Yegge is interesting, but a little insane, in the best possible way. I was using beads, but it was way too unstable, and didn't play nicely with Jujutsu workspaces, so I've been trying out alternatives.

- V.E. Schwab's _A Conjuring of Light_. Popcorn fantasy that my wife picked up in Bali. We originally started by reading them to each other, but she doesn't like her own voice, so I'm reading this one myself.

## Viewing

Starfleet Academy, catching up on Star Trek: Discovery, and slowly rewatching The Good Place.

## D&D

Playing an Order of the Ancients paladin in a Faerun campaign every week. When I have time, which is rarely, I've been making resin dice.
