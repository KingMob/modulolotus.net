Still in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Entering the burning season. 

Killed my SaaS idea for test impact analysis. Looking for a new one, preferably something more viable. Thanks, capitalism.

Still adding bind support to the OSH shell for Oils. Just down to `bind -x` now. 

Started playing D&D again. I'm a lvl 6 Blood Hunter in a Curse of Strahd campaign.
