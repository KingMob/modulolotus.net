Longer code block:

```
(defn conflicting-events
  "Given a collection of events, returns all conflicting event pairs in
   O(n log n) time. The algorithm does a comparison sort in O(n log n) time,
   and then computes conflicts in O(n) time. It steps through each event once
   in order, keeping running track of prior events that are currently occurring."

Klipse test:

```klipse-cljs
(map #(* % %) (range 10))
```

Klipse ruby:
```klipse-ruby
(0...10).map {|i| i * i}
```
