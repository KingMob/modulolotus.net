I play games pretty slowly these days. Never finished Myst. Still working on Cuphead.

My wife and I played [Undertale](https://undertale.com/) a couple years after it came out, and loved it. 

I started playing [Zachtronics](https://www.zachtronics.com/)'s [EXAPUNKS](https://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks/) a few years ago, and finally beat it last fall, only to hear that Zachtronics was closing down and moving on *(UPDATE: The Zachtronics games are still available, and Zach eventually returned to making games with his new company, [Coincidence](https://coincidence.games/).)* EXAPUNKS is essentially "Assembly language: the game" meets Neuromancer. After a long day of high-level abstraction in your code, sometimes you just want to twiddle some bits.

One of the missions involves hacking a Virtual Boy-like game system, but you can also make freeform games for it, so I made this "demo" of Undertale's Asriel battle in EXAPUNKS. 

For my own amusement, I'm pretending to have "found" it while hopping dimensions; we'll see if anyone's fooled. 

Enjoy!
