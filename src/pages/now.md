# Matthew Davidson

## Where I'm at

Still in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The burning season is almost over, time for Songkran, where the city turns into a massive watergun battle! 

## What I'm doing now

Killed my SaaS idea for test impact analysis. Looking for a new one, preferably something more viable. Might start with my old company Swarmify.

Adding bind support to the OSH shell for Oils. Adding readline environment variable support.

## For fun

Playing D&D again. I'm a lvl 6 Blood Hunter in a Curse of Strahd campaign. We just finished fighting a corrupted druid at the Wizard of Wines vineyard.
