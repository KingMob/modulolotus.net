# Matthew Davidson

## Where I'm at

Chiang Mai, Thailand. It's been nicely overcast lately. Honestly, sometimes you just get sick of the sun in the tropics.

## What I'm doing now

I am taking over as co-owner of [Swarmify](https://swarmify.com), the startup I was CTO for many years ago. I'm modernizing the codebase, addressing bug reports, etc. Just working a lot.

Bind support to osh was added, but to get Warp working with it, I still need to get some history and shopt flags working. Unfortunately, I'm working weekends more.

## For fun

D&D is on hiatus while the DM is on summer vacation. Right now, I'm reading Vandermeer's latest Southern Reach book, Absolution. The wife and I are binging Andor; we just finished, so up next is Rogue One, follwoed by the original Star Wars.
