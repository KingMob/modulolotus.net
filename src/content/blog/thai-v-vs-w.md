The Thai language doesn't have a "v" sound. So, many Thai people use the "w" sound as a "v" substitute when pronouncing English words with "v".

The thing is, they're not close. "V" is formed by placing the lower lip against the upper teeth. "W" involves making a circle with the lips, then relaxing them. What's confusing is, the Thai language *does* have an "f" found, which is much closer to the English "v". (Try them all out in your mouth to feel the similarity.)

I've seen a variety of explanations online that make sense historically, but not linguistically (at least, not to this amateur). They range from: RTGS transliteration of Indian/Pali/Sanskrit-origin words that involve "v", Chinese diaspora pronunciation of a [combined w/v sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_labiodental_approximant), regional dialects, and just plain "we were taught that w and v are the same".

So why would a less-similar consonant be chosen over a more-similar one? Back down the linguistic rabbit hole...
