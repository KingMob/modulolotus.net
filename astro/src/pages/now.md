# Matthew Davidson

## Where I'm at

Still in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Entering the burning season. 

## What I'm doing now

Killed my SaaS idea for test impact analysis. Looking for a new one, preferably something more viable. 

Adding bind support to the OSH shell for Oils. Just down to `bind -x` now. 

## For fun

Started playing D&D again. I'm a lvl 6 Blood Hunter in a Curse of Strahd campaign.
