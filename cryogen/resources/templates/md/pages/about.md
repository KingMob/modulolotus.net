## About

My name is Matthew Davidson. I'm a software engineer, former neuroscientist, serial startup CTO, and former Buddhist monk, for like, two weeks. I can be found on GitHub as [KingMob](https://github.com/KingMob/), where I'm the current maintainer of [Aleph](https://github.com/clj-commons/aleph) and [Manifold](https://github.com/clj-commons/manifold).

I have a wife and a beard. I'm overseas these days, currently living in Thailand.

Sometimes I play D&D.
