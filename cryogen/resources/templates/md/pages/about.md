## About

I'm a software developer and former neuroscientist. I just wrapped up being CTO of a startup. I can be found on GitHub as [KingMob](https://github.com/KingMob/).

I've built complete systems from top to bottom and helmed small teams. Need someone to solve your problems with code? I'm currently available.

I have a fianc√©, two cats, and a beard. I live in Brooklyn.
