## About

My name is Matthew Davidson. I'm a software engineer, former neuroscientist, and serial startup CTO. I can be found on GitHub as [KingMob](https://github.com/KingMob/).

I've built complete systems from top to bottom and helmed small teams. Need someone to solve your problems with code? I'm available.

I have a wife, a cat, and a beard. I live in Brooklyn.

Sometimes I play D&D.
